# Burger Franchise

## Description
This project is to be used by fast food chain worldwide to display the prices of their menu items. This project prompts the user for a country, and then using this country,
it pulls from two online APIs, one to get the exchange rates, and one to get the symbol for the currency of that country. Once the user has changed up the contents of the burgers
and set the prices, this application uses HTML to demonstrate the final product whcih would be something straight out of McDonald's.

## Getting Started
-This application no longer runs because it was created in Spring 2022 and the APIs have since depracted. It could easily be redone and if I have time, I will.

### Executing program

-javac -cp ".;jars/json-simple-1.1.1.jar" myFranchise.java

## Acknowledgments

- This was a project I created for a class in high school. The names are all strange because the focuses of this project were to learn how to use APIs,
  as well as inheritance, polymorphism, OOP, etc.
